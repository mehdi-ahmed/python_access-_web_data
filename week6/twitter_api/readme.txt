The Twitter API can be used to programmatically retrieve and analyze data, as well as engage with the conversation
on Twitter.
#
# This API provides access to a variety of different resources including the following:
#
# Tweets
# Users
# Direct Messages
# Lists
# Trends
# Media
# Places

# You'll need an app and API key in order to authenticate and integrate with most Twitter developer products. Create
# an app to get your API key.

All new developers must apply for a developer account to access the Twitter developer platform. Once approved,
you can begin to use our new Twitter API v2, or our v1.1 standard and premium APIs.


Step 1: Approved developer account
In order to get started with the new Twitter API, you need an approved developer account. If you do not have one yet, you can apply for one. Once you have an approved developer account, proceed to the next step.


Step 2: Create a Project and connect an App
Next, in the developer portal, create a new Project.
